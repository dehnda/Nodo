# NodeFluxEngine Example Output

This directory contains mesh files generated by the NodeFluxEngine examples.

## Generated Files

- `box1.obj` - First box mesh (0,0,0) to (2,2,2)
- `box2.obj` - Second box mesh (1,1,1) to (3,3,3) 
- `union_result.obj` - Boolean union of box1 and box2

## Viewing the OBJ Files

You can view these files in any 3D modeling software that supports OBJ format, such as:

- **Blender** (Free): Import via File → Import → Wavefront (.obj)
- **MeshLab** (Free): Open directly
- **Online viewers**: 
  - https://3dviewer.net
  - https://imagetostl.com/obj-viewer

## File Format

The OBJ files use the standard Wavefront format:
- `v x y z` - Vertex coordinates
- `f v1 v2 v3` - Triangle faces (1-indexed)

## Boolean Operation Result

The union operation combines two overlapping 2×2×2 cubes:
- Box1: Corner at origin (0,0,0)
- Box2: Corner at (1,1,1) 
- Result: Combined volume without interior faces

The resulting mesh should show a single connected solid representing the union of both input boxes.
